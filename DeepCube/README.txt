Use ctg/avi.py to train, search/astar.py to search, and scripts/compare_solutions.py to compare results.

Terminal instructions to train, search, and compare with optimal solution are in train.sh.
You can use train.sh file to test, or use each instructions in terminal.

Training will require relatively long time and high-spec system. In my case it took about 40 hours using
Microsoft Azure data-science virtual machine.

If you want to use already trained database, use search/astar.py and scripts/compare_solutions.py only.
